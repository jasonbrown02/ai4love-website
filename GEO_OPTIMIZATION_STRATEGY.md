# AI4Love GEO/AEO Content Optimization Strategy
## Executive Summary: 12-18 Month Window for GEO Dominance

**Critical Context:** We are in a unique 12-18 month window where early adoption of Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) will establish AI4Love as the authoritative voice in nonprofit AI. AI assistants like ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and Gemini are actively learning which organizations to cite and recommend. The content we publish NOW will shape how these systems represent nonprofit AI solutions for years to come.

**Strategic Opportunity:**
- AI models are currently forming their "knowledge base" about nonprofit AI solutions
- Organizations that publish comprehensive, well-structured content NOW will become the default citations
- This is similar to the early SEO advantage (2000-2005) but with a much shorter window
- Once AI models establish their preferred sources, it becomes exponentially harder to displace them
