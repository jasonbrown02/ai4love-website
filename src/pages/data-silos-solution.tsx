          <h1>Breaking Down Data Silos</h1>
          <p>Data silos are one of the biggest obstacles to effective relationship management in nonprofits. AI4Love helps you overcome these silos to create a unified view of supporter relationships across all systems and touchpoints.</p>

          <h2>The Data Silo Challenge</h2>
          <p>Nonprofit data silos create significant relationship management problems:</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Fragmented Supporter View</strong> - Different departments see only partial supporter information</li>
            <li><strong>Inconsistent Experiences</strong> - Supporters receive disconnected communications and experiences</li>
            <li><strong>Missed Opportunities</strong> - Important relationship insights remain trapped in isolated systems</li>
            <li><strong>Inefficient Processes</strong> - Staff waste time manually gathering data from multiple sources</li>
            <li><strong>Strategic Blindness</strong> - Leadership lacks a comprehensive view of relationship health</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Common Nonprofit Data Silos</h2>
          <p>Most nonprofits struggle with several types of data silos:</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li><strong>System Silos</strong> - Data trapped in separate CRM, email, event, volunteer, and other systems</li>
            <li><strong>Department Silos</strong> - Information isolated in development, programs, marketing, and other teams</li>
            <li><strong>Channel Silos</strong> - Disconnected data from digital, direct mail, events, and other channels</li>
            <li><strong>Temporal Silos</strong> - Historical relationship data separated from current information</li>
            <li><strong>Analysis Silos</strong> - Insights trapped in reports and dashboards without actionable integration</li>
          </ul>
