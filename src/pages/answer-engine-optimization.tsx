          <h2>AEO Content Structure Best Practices</h2>

          <h3>1. Question-Headline Format</h3>
          <p>Structure your content with clear question headlines that match search queries:</p>
          
          <div className="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg my-4">
            <p className="font-mono text-sm">
              <strong>Instead of:</strong> "Financial Information"<br/>
              <strong>Use:</strong> "What Percentage of Donations Goes to Programs?"
            </p>
          </div>

          <h3>2. Immediate Answer Pattern</h3>
          <p>Provide the direct answer in the first 1-2 sentences, then elaborate:</p>
          
          <div className="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg my-4">
            <p className="text-sm">
              <strong>Example:</strong><br/>
              "85% of donations to [Organization Name] go directly to programs and services. Our administrative costs are kept to just 10%, with 5% allocated to fundraising activities. This efficiency rating places us in the top 15% of nonprofits in our sector..."
            </p>
          </div>

          <h3>3. Structured List Answers</h3>
          <p>Use numbered or bulleted lists for multi-part answers:</p>
          
          <div className="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg my-4">
            <p className="text-sm">
              <strong>How to Volunteer with [Organization]:</strong><br/>
              1. Complete our online volunteer application<br/>
              2. Attend a virtual orientation session<br/>
              3. Choose from available opportunities<br/>
              4. Complete any required training<br/>
              5. Begin your volunteer service

          </div>

          <h2>Technical AEO Implementation</h2>

          <h3>FAQ Schema Markup</h3>
          <p>Implement FAQ schema to increase featured snippet eligibility:</p>

    }
  }]
}`}
          </div>

          <h3>How-To Schema for Processes</h3>

          <h2>Content Optimization Strategies</h2>

          <h3>The 40-60 Word Rule</h3>
          <p>
            Featured snippets typically display 40-60 words. Craft your direct answers within this limit for maximum visibility.
          </p>

          <h3>Use Natural Language</h3>
          <p>
            Write answers as if responding to a supporter's verbal question. This optimization works for both voice search and conversational AI.
          </p>

          <h3>Include Context and Credibility</h3>
          <p>
            Always provide context for your answers and cite credible sources when possible. This builds trust and authority.
          </p>

          <h2>Frequently Asked Questions About AEO</h2>

          <h3>What is Answer Engine Optimization (AEO)?</h3>
          <p>
            Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) is the practice of optimizing content to appear in direct answer formats like featured snippets, voice search results, and AI-powered answer engines. For nonprofits, AEO helps donors and volunteers find immediate answers to their questions about your mission, impact, and opportunities.
          </p>

          <h3>How does AEO differ from traditional SEO for nonprofits?</h3>
          <p>
            While SEO focuses on ranking in search results, AEO optimizes for being the direct answer to specific questions. For nonprofits, this means structuring content to answer questions like "How much of my donation goes to programs?" or "What volunteer opportunities are available?" in formats that search engines can extract and display directly.
          </p>

          <h3>What types of nonprofit questions should I optimize for with AEO?</h3>
          <p>
            Focus on donor questions (impact metrics, financial transparency, donation process), volunteer questions (opportunities, requirements, time commitment), and general inquiries (mission, leadership, contact information). These represent the most common information-seeking behaviors of nonprofit supporters.
          </p>

          <h2>Getting Started with AEO</h2>
          
          <p>
            Begin your AEO journey by auditing your current content for question-answer opportunities. Identify the top 10 questions supporters ask about your organization, then restructure your content to provide clear, immediate answers.
          </p>

          <p>
            Remember: AEO isn't about gaming search engines—it's about genuinely helping supporters find the information they need to engage with your mission.
